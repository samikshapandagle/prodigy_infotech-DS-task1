# Task 1: Visualizing Data Distribution
 Project : Prodigy InfoTech Internship

# Objective:
The goal of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable within a population dataset. This involves analyzing the dataset and choosing an appropriate visualization technique to effectively represent the data distribution.

# Details:

Dataset: Population data (age, gender, etc.)
Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn
Task:
Load and preprocess the dataset
Identify the variable to be visualized (e.g., age or gender)
Create a bar chart or histogram to represent the distribution of the selected variable
Interpret the results and provide insights based on the visualization
Outcome: A clear and informative visualization that highlights the distribution of a specific variable within the population data, aiding in understanding the data's characteristics and trends.
